By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder and then deploy to the Github Pages branch `gh-pages`.<br>
After deployed the app will be available at https://vandre.leal.github.io/github-explorer
